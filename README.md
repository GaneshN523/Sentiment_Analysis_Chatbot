Mental Health & Diagnosis Chatbot
This project is a Mental Health & Diagnosis Chatbot that combines sentiment analysis with a simple rule-based symptom diagnosis system. The chatbot analyzes user input to detect emotional tone using NLTK's VADER and provides tailored mental health tips. Additionally, it attempts a basic diagnosis by matching user-described symptoms with pre-defined conditions. Note: This is an educational demo and should not replace professional medical advice.
